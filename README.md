# ü§ñ Self-Balancing Car with Bluetooth Control

> ‚ÄúBalance is not something you find; it‚Äôs something you create ‚Äî with a PID.‚Äù

This project demonstrates a self-balancing two-wheeled robot car powered by an Arduino UNO, using **MPU6050 sensor** data and a **PID control algorithm** to keep itself upright. The system also includes an **HC-05 Bluetooth module** for remote control via smartphone ‚Äî combining **real-time sensor control** with **wireless manual override**.

## üß† Introduction

The **Self-Balancing Car** is a dynamic robotic vehicle that balances itself upright using data from the MPU6050 sensor and responds to corrections calculated by a PID control system. The onboard **HC-05 Bluetooth module** allows wireless commands to move forward, backward, and turn ‚Äî all while actively balancing.

This project explores the integration of real-time feedback, embedded control, and wireless communication in a compact robotic system.

## üß© Problem It Solves

- Keeps a two-wheeled vehicle **upright and balanced** in real time.
- Enables **remote control via Bluetooth**, without disturbing the balance loop.
- Demonstrates real-world implementation of PID feedback systems.
- Lays the groundwork for building autonomous balancing robots and vehicles.

## üíª Software & Code Details

- **Platform:** Arduino IDE
- **Language:** C++
- **Libraries Required:**
  - `Wire.h` for I2C communication
  - `EEPROM.h` for storing PID constants
  - `SoftwareSerial.h` for Bluetooth (if not using default Serial)
  - Custom PID and MPU6050 filter code
- **Control Logic:**
  - Uses a **Kalman filter** (or complementary filter) to stabilize MPU6050 sensor readings.
  - Applies a **PID loop** to continuously calculate and correct the tilt error.
  - Interprets **Bluetooth commands** to override directional movement (forward, backward, left, right) while balancing.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. The MPU6050 measures the **tilt (pitch) angle**.
2. Arduino applies a **Kalman/complementary filter** for noise reduction.
3. A **PID algorithm** calculates the error from the upright setpoint and adjusts motor speeds accordingly.
4. HC-05 receives serial commands from a phone (via Bluetooth Controller app).
5. Manual commands are blended with balance logic to allow controlled movement.

## üîß Current Project Status

‚úÖ **Balancing:** Working fine with stable PID tuning  
‚ö†Ô∏è **Bluetooth Control:** Currently unstable ‚Äì communication is established, but real-time tuning and movement override still under refinement  
üîÑ **EEPROM Integration:** Working ‚Äî PID constants persist between restarts
